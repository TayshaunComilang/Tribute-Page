        Josephine "Becca" Agatlao Comilang (March 1957 – March 19, 2024) dedicated her life to teaching, inspiring generations of students at Pacalso Elementary School and other schools during her career. She loved teaching mother tongue (kankanaey) and believed in the power of education to change lives.

        Known for her generosity, she often helped many struggling families and students, ensuring that they could graduate including those who were not her own children. She supported them financially, emotionally and even by providing a home when needed. She would give everything she had to help others even if it meant having nothing left for herself. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond teaching, Grandma loved dancing, playing table tennis and singing, filling every room with joy and warmth. Her spirit and love will always remain in the hearts of those she touched.
